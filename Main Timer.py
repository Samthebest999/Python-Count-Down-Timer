wyltkwabw = input("So, now would you like to know why you should use this count down timer instead of one you found on the web Yes/No (Case Sensitive)")
if wyltkwabw == "Yes":
    print("""The reason you should use this countdown clock and not some clock you find on the internet is:
    1. It is very lightweight on that topic, it is great beacuse your browser takes a heavy load on your computer... you can leave this open in the background and it will use very little computer resources as it is coded in python.
    2. It is very fast unlike the ones on the web browser the javascript for those websites is very complicated and has a slower execution time. My program runs on simple subtraction and displaying numbers.
